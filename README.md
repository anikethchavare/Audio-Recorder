# Audio Recorder (v1.0.0)

This is a simple web app that demonstrates how you can record audio using JavaScript.

Check it out [here](https://anikethchavare.vercel.app/projects/audio-recorder).

## Downloading

Download the files and store it in a single directory. You don't need to install any external libraries/packages.

## Running the Web App

Open `index.html` in the `src` folder. You can see two buttons: Start and Stop.

## How to Use?

Clicking `Start` records your audio, after asking your permission. Clicking `Stop` stops the recording and downloads the mp3 file (Audio.mp3) of your recording. It also plays the recording in the tab.
